learning env where coding is good times

## Pair Program with Me:  
https://calendly.com/matthewbcool

### You will get a lot of opinions about how to learn how to code. This is what I would start with: (if you want to learn web stuff) 

### General: 
1. Don't get overwhelmed by the sheer mass of everything out there to learn. 
2. Commit to doing it everyday, even if it is just for 10-20min. (I do this) 
3. Producing something is better than producing nothing. 
4. Have fun, ask questions, join communities- pair program. 

### Sites I like:
https://teamtreehouse.com/home
they have some nice videos- i like em.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/
ffc gets some grief for overselling but I don't see anything wrong with running through it- they have some solid material and it's free.

### Things I wish I understood well from the start (web dev)
1. Reading/understanding the docs carefully- many answers can be found in the documentation of whatever technology you are using
2. Using the Dev Console in chrome (or some other web browser)
